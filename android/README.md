# Maptime Mobile Mapping Workshop - Android platform

## Installation instructions

In order to spend less time configuring a new project and more time building, the Android project in this folder contains an app already set up with the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android.

You will need to complete a couple of more steps to get it running:

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Open the Android app's folder (`maptime-mobile-workshop/android/maptime-mobile`) when Android Studio gives you the option to `Open an exisiting Android Studio project`.
2. Remain in Android Studio and then double tap the `Shift` key on your keyboard to open a search bar. Type `strings.xml` to find and open the project's `strings.xml` file. Alternatively, you can find the file by following this path `maptime-mobile-workshop/android/maptime-mobile/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`.
3. Find the `mapbox_access_token` string value in the `strings.xml` file, and enter your access token as a string value where it says `PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`. You can find your access token at https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/.
4. Press the ![Screen Shot 2019-04-10 at 12 27 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/55907662-3983d180-5b8c-11e9-84ed-c3c4784bcb42.png)
button found towards the top left corner, to run the project. If you don't see a map but your app runs, make sureÂ that you've entered your access token correctly.

You should see this! ðŸ‘‰  ![ezgif com-resize (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/56067873-9bca0700-5d31-11e9-930b-bdb0a1632056.gif)


## Task 2 
### Understanding the basics of the Mapbox Maps SDKs for Android

First make sure that you've gone through the installation instructions found at the top of this page.

All of your code will go in the `MainActivity` file. Every time you want run this file, you will need to re-run the application. Comments are prefaced with a double forward slash (`//`), and will guide you through the exercises.

## Task 3 
### Advanced topics within the Mapbox Maps SDKs for Android

First make sure that you've gone through the installation instructions found at the top of this page.

To set up your project for the next round of tasks, navigate to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and move the following intent filter to the `TaskThreeActivity` section in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This is to tell the Android app to use the `TaskThreeActivity` file as the first screen displayed when the app opens. 

```
<intent-filter>
	<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
 	<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter> 
```

Delete the intent filter from the `<activity android:name=".MainActivity">` section in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

Once you've completed this, you can move on to more advanced tasks by working in the `TaskThreeActivity` file. Comments are prefaced with a double forward slash (`//`), and will guide you through the next set of exercises.

Your goal is something similar to ðŸ‘‰ ![ezgif com-resize (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/56252412-87a54300-606c-11e9-8405-481076cbf97c.gif)
